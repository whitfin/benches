# benches

Recently I got tired of not having a logical place to benchmark code in various languages - I had files all over the place. Instead of this I'd rather have my code organized in a repo so it's both easy to browse, and easy to share.

There are various sub-directories for different languages, each with their own README on how to run benchmarks for that language (because obviously they're all different). In future I might try write some form of tooling around this repo to make it easier, but for now it's pretty raw.

This project is mainly for personal use but if anyone would like to add their own benchmarks, feel free to add a PR. Always good to learn new things :)
